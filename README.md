# IML Keras Workshop

This repository holds the slides and examples of the IML Keras workshop.

The workshop has three parts:

1. Introduction to [Keras](www.keras.io) itself using the MNIST dataset
2. Tutorial for the Keras interface shipped with [ROOT/TMVA](root.cern.ch)
3. (Optional) Usage of Keras and [lwtnn](https://github.com/lwtnn/lwtnn)

## Software Requirements

This software requirements cover part 1 and 2. Due to the lack of time, most likely we won't be able to try the examples from part 3 during the workshop. Option 1 is highly recommended.

- **Option 1:** Use lxplus, everything is already there! Just run `source setup_lxplus.sh` on lxplus.
- **Option 2:** Use SWAN, everything works there as well. Go to swan.cern.ch and open a terminal using the `New` button.
- **Option 3:** Install the software on your own device. The script `setup_virtualenv.sh` does this job for you. You need a running installation of `virtualenv` for this! As well, for part 2 you need a recent ROOT version above or equal v6.08.
